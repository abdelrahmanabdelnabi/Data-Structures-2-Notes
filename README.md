## Week 1
### Complexity Analysis
Computer scientists make heavy use of a specialized asymptotic notation to describe the growth of functions approximately. The notation involves six weird little symbols.

see the [mathematics for computer science][mathcs] reference section 11.3 and the [asymtotics cheat sheet][asymcheatsheet] for more details
